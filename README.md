## Inspiration
The idea for this app arose when Meetup drastically increased its fees, forcing many small hiking groups to shut down.  WNC Hiking Hub aims to provide a **free and community-focused alternative** to help hikers connect and organize adventures together.

## Mission
WNC Hiking Hub's mission is to **connect outdoor enthusiasts** in Western North Carolina who want to explore the beauty of the region while enjoying the company of like-minded adventurers. 

Developed with React and JavaScript, the app is designed to be **intuitive and engaging**, allowing users to:
* **Post hikes** and invite others to join
* **Browse existing hikes** to participate in
* **Have a personal profile page** showcasing their bio and hiking history

## Upcoming Features
The app is currently in beta-testing stage. Based on the feedback received, I will decide which additional features to add. Here are some features I have in mind:

### General Features:
* Introduce a paid membership option and reserve some of the participant features below for premium users
* Create a mobile app version people can download on their device
* Integrate AllTrails API (if it becomes available)

### Participant Features:
* Earn levels and badges based on hike attendance and display them on user bio
* Connect with other users via in-app messaging or Slack
* Opt in for updates on new hikes, changes, or cancellations
* Participate in challenges (like earning a badge by hiking to 10 waterfalls)
* Organize specialized groups (like women-only, waterfall enthusiasts)
* Earn leader certifications by completing a certain number of hikes
