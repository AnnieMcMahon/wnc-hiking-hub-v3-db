## Inspiration
The idea for this app arose when Meetup drastically increased its fees, forcing many small hiking groups to shut down.  WNC Hiking Hub aims to provide a **free and community-focused alternative** to help hikers connect and organize adventures together.

## Mission

Developed with React and JavaScript, the app is designed to be **intuitive and engaging**, allowing users to:
* **Post hikes** and invite others to join
* **Browse existing hikes** to participate in
* **Have a personal profile page** showcasing their bio and hiking history
